The woodworms project aims to simplify hardware development by providing a set of convenient scripts and tools. It also include a powerful Python module that allows developers to access libfdt raw API directly from Python, eliminating the need to learn C. Additionally, it offers a more user-friendly API for working with FDT. With this module, developers can use Python code to generate device tree source files and flattened device tree (FDT), parse existing FDT, and handle various software development tasks.
